downloading:
if the sra files are double ended, should we split them in fastq-dump?
trimming
how many threads should I use? (-threads)
What quality score should be the cuttoff for low quality bases? How do I specify that in trimmomatic? I seem to only have the options -phred33 and -phred64
what should our sliding window be? (SLIDINGWINDOW:5:20)
are their any adapter sequences I should search for? (TruSeq_adapters.fa)
what parameters do we need for adapater clipping? (ILLUMINACLIP)
what adapater read alignment settings should we use? (2:30:10)
after the trimming, can we delete the raw files?
after trimming paired end files, which output files can we delete?

mapping:
when creating a genome index, how do I know I'm using the right genome and annotation files?
Should we even use annotation files? Because I'm having a weird issue with gff3 format. Will it mess up our results to not use annotation files?
When do we use annotations for mapping?
	since you are mapping to the lncRNA sequences extracted from the genome, you do not need to supply the gtf file

How long does it take STAR to map your files? Because for me it's taking 40 minutes for each sequence read archive. 
What is your RNA-seq pipeline?



what is an annotation file?
	annotations seem to be gff3 or gft files.

what is an assembly file?
	assembly files seem to be .fa or fasta files. 

is a reference genome an annotation or assembly file?
	a reference genome is NOT an annotation file. Implied by https://bioinformatics.uconn.edu/resources-and-events/tutorials/rna-seq-tutorial-with-reference-genome/
	we can get them here? ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-86/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/

what is a gene set?
	gene set is a fasta file. implied by links found at https://cofactorgenomics.com/choosing-a-reference-for-your-rna-seq-experiment/



In this project: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=ERP108822
several of the files have "_L" or "_R" in the name like "OR 13L" or "Cntl 3R". What does that mean? 
	is it left and right? 
	What about the OR and the Cntrl?
	what does the number by L and R mean?
	Could I use them both in the same RNAseq pipeline or would they not intersect (or something like that)?

how did you get your computer to not lock after 5 minutes? My computer keeps resetting the brightness & lock settings whenever I try to change them.
