# RNAseq-Software-Tutorial
A website showing how to install and use various bioinformatics software that would be used in Dr. Zhong's bioinformatics graduage class. Together, the software can be used in a RNA-seq pipeline. Made under and during Dr. Zhong's employment during the summer of 2018.
The website is now in use at this url: https://cbb.ittc.ku.edu/RNAseq/Menu.html
